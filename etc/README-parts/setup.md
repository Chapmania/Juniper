# Setup

## Installation

There are two ways to install Juniper.

- [Download the UnityPackage](Juniper.unitypackage) and install it in your project, or
- [Clone the repository](https://github.com/capnmidnight/Juniper) and copy the contents of the `src/Juniper/Assets/Juniper/` directory to your Assets folder in a directory named `Juniper`. This will also give you access to the `examples/` directory to see how projects are setup with Juniper.
