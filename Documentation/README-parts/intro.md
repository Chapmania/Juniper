# Juniper For Fun and Profit

# Introduction

Juniper is a framework within Unity 3D for managing and developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality applications, within the context of a metaphor of the human body. It provides the following sub-modules:

- *Animation* - Basic animations on specific, common object properties, without having to engage the full power of Mecanim.
- *Audio* - Audio management and effects components.
- *Data* - Managing HTTP requests and streaming assets, all from background threads that do not lock up the main UI thread.
- *Editor* - Custom editors for Juniper's Unity Components to make them easier to edit within the Unity Editor. Also includes the Unit Tests for all other code modules.
- *Extensions* - Useful functions to add on top of Unity and .NET's existing classes.
- *Haptics* - Components for performing high-quality haptic feedback on systems that support it.
- *Imaging* - Loading and processing PNG and raw images.
- *Input* - Handling user input: keyboard, mouse, touch, motion controllers, and speech.
- *Light Mapping* - Swapping light map sets at runtime to have different, baked lighting conditions without switching scenes.
- *Statistics* - Collections that perform statistical analysis on their contents.
- *Widgets* - Visual elements with which the user may interact.
- *World* - Components for understanding and integrating with the real world: light estimation, global positioning, translating between spatial reference systems, receiving weather reports.
- *Units* - Conversions between and formattings of values tagged with units of measure.
- *XR* - Management of VR and AR hardware, specifically the detection of surfaces and the tracking of positional hardware.
- *Other* - Scene and project management tools, for managing complex scene hierarchies in the Unity editor and at runtime.
