# On Conduct

My name is Sean T. McBeth. I build free, open source software in my free time. I do it for the enjoyment of creating things.

I release the projects online in the hopes that others may enjoy them, too. And I open them for contributions in the event that someone finds the code useful and wants to experience the joy of creating within the project's bounds.

Throughout this process, the experience must be enjoyable for all people involved. That means being nice and polite to each other. If you don't know what that means:
A) I kind of don't believe you, however
B) There are a number of resources online that can help you learn how to be polite to other people, while still expressing your opinions about work.
 * ["If You Can't Say Something Nice, What DO You Say?" Practical Solution for Working Together Better](https://www.amazon.com/You-Cant-Something-Nice-What-ebook/dp/B00EQ1H51Q/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?crid=PQXG1RO9VQYB&keywords=if+you+can%27t+say+something+nice%2C+what+do+you+say&qid=1551190107&s=gateway&sprefix=if+you+can%27t+say%2Caps%2C122&sr=8-1-fkmrnull) by Sarita Maybin. An excellent, short, easy-reading book with lots of actionable advice on how to politely deal with conflict resolution. It is current free on Amazon Kindle Unlimited.
 * [How To Be Polite While You're Online: Practicing Good Netiquette](https://www.simplehelp.net/2006/08/14/how-to-be-polite-while-youre-online-practicing-good-netiquette/) by Ross McKillop. While the article is a bit old (though only compared to the pace of life on the Internet) the advice is still very good.

Examples of things that will not be allowed:
* Sexual language of any kind. My projects are not dating sites. It's highly unlikely to be welcome for the receipient, so just don't take the chance.
* [Harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment) of any kind. It's illegal.
 * There is a lot of confusion over harassment, largely perpetuated by a media industry bent on making it seem like it's not a real thing. A good, general rule of thumb to keep in mind is: if someone asks you to stop, you stop. That may even be too late. Don't chase people down for conversation. Leave them alone if they don't reply to you right away.
* Prejudiced language, including:
 * Racial slurs,
 * Sexual epithets,
 * Misgendering people who request to be referred to in specific ways,
 * Fat shaming
 * Thin shaming
 * etc.
* Calling someone "stupid" or something they've done "dumb".
* Any of the above, cast as "just a joke". I've never heard any "joke" that was funny that had to end with, "it was just a joke". If this happens to you a lot, maybe you're just bad at jokes and should give up the practice.

# On Reporting Conduct Issues

If ever you feel like you are a victim of harassment on this, or any of my other projects, or in any way I might be able to help, you can find all of my contact information on [my personal website](https://www.seanmcbeth.com). You may contact me and I will keep you anonymous. I have a lot of experience with organizing and unfortunately I've had to enforce rules before.

# On Consequences

This document is not a complete enumeration of all the ways in which one is not allowed to offend another person. Noone is allowed to offend anyone in any way. I shouldn't have to tell you how to be polite to others. Unfortunately, some people see a list like above and try to figure out how they can skirt the letter-of-the-law to still be able to take jabs at people. YOU MUST ABIDE BY THE SPIRIT OF THIS DOCUMENT!

I reserve the right to ban people from my projects for whatever reason I deem fit. And no, you are not owed an explanation. To make someone feel bad through an interaction involving one of my projects is in direct opposition to the purpose of the project. Software is for people, first and foremost. Disrespect the people and I will kick you out. If I know you in person, I might even stop talking to you.
